# DeviceBit modbus device service

Label： modbus

---
The following part mainly introduces how to connect modbus device with DeviceBit platform directly by DTU.

## 1 Introduction
### 1.1 DeviceBit modbus device service

Without program, connect modbus device with DeviceBit platform directly by DTU.

### 1.2 Advantage

Modbus is one of the most common industrial equipment protocol, and the related equipment and instrument are innumerable. Just select a suitable MODBUS device and a universal DTU, you can directly connect the device with DeviceBit platform.

> For example: gas detector, power meter, water meter, or anyone sold on the market or the internet.

### 1.3 Why can they connect directly?

Modbus device connects to modbus tcp server provided by DeviceBit by DTU. Modbus tcp server finds the account information on DeviceBit of modbus device through DTU registration package, and initiate data request to modbus device through registers for modbus device in Devicebit account. Then, the data read is stored directly for the device in DeviceBit account.

## 2 Connection Steps
Access to the platform requires the following 3 steps,
1. Sign up one account on DeviceBit; Write account information in DTU as a registration package.
2. Set registers for modbus device on DeviceBit.
3. Connect DTU with modbus device.


The main working procedure is as following:


### 2.1 First simulate one modbus device, as the following picture shows. Two register addresses :0 1, and the values are 12 13 separately.

### 2.2 Sign up one account and add a new device. Please notice all the settings.

### 2.3 Get the registration package from the account and write it in DTU.
About how to get the registration package, please refer to[乐联网DTU 教程2 ：用DTU把JSY-149 单项电表接入乐联网][4]

About how to write the registration package in DTU, there are different methods for different DTU. It depends on yourself.
Writting the registration package in DTU means the connection between device and DeviceBit is established.

### 2.4 Connect modbus device with DTU

### 2.5 Test by modbus console

### 2.6 Add sensors to collect data automatically
The sensor naming rule is the S+ register address, for example, the register 0 is S0, and if the register has two addresses, such as register 1-2, the name is S1-2.
