The user key is very important and unique for each account. The DeviceBit system distinguishes your gateways, devices and applications with others by different user keys.

# 6.2 Sub-account Settings
Once you have registered your account on DeviceBit platform, you can define several sub-accounts under your main account, giving the sub-accounts different authorizations. For example, one of your sub-account has the right to query without the right to add a sensor or a controller and modify personal information. Thus, your account is operated as an administrator, and could assign a number of sub-accounts. You can let somebody else maintain your equipment without having to worry that he accidentally delete or misuse your equipment.
Go to ***My Account ->Sub-account ->Add A Sub-user***
